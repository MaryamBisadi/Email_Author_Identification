# Email_Author_Identification
Objective of this code is to classify a set of emails based only on the text of the email. Half of the emails were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company. The classification has been done by Navie Bayes, SVM and Decision Tree techniques and accuracy and training time of each one has been caculated.  

The data used for this project has been downloaded from https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects/tree/master/tools

## Naive Bayes

Each unique word is considered as a feature. The relative simplicity of the Naive Baye and the independent features assumption  make it a strong performer for classifying texts.

training time: 1.306 s

accuracy: 0.9732650739476678

## SVM
